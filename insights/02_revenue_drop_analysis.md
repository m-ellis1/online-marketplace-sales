## 3. Full-Year Category Trend (Context)

Comparing May–July against Jan–April:

## 4. High-Impact Category Focus

**Key insight:**  

- Revenue drop is concentrated in **Electronics, Home Appliances, and Clothing**.  
- Suggests business should investigate:  
  1. Product-level sales shifts (which SKUs dropped in AOV?)  
  2. Pricing or promotions in May–July  
  3. Opportunities to increase average order value (bundling, upsells)

---

**Takeaway:**  

> The revenue decline from May to July 2024 was **not due to fewer orders**, but **smaller and cheaper purchases in high-impact categories**. Any revenue recovery strategy should target increasing AOV and understanding category-level purchasing behavior.
