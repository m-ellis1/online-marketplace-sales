Comparing May–July against January–April performance:

- Electronics and Home Appliances experienced revenue softening without significant unit loss.
- Clothing shows sharper AOV fluctuations relative to unit changes.
- Lower-value categories (Books, Beauty Products, Sports) exhibit mixed or neutral trends and contribute minimally to the overall revenue decline.

## 4. Key Takeaways

- High-ticket categories account for most of the revenue impact.
- Recovery efforts should focus on improving average order value rather than increasing order volume.
