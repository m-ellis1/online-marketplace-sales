# Online Sales Revenue Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes online marketplace sales data to understand overall business performance and investigate a revenue decline observed in mid-2024. Using SQL, I explore core KPIs, monthly revenue trends, and product category performance to identify the drivers behind changing revenue patterns.

The analysis focuses on distinguishing whether the decline was driven by fewer orders or by changes in customer purchasing behavior.
